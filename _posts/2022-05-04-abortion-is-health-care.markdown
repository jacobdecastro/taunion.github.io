The fight for transit equity must not leave behind people across the country who will be forced to travel hundreds of miles for abortions â€” many of whom cannot afford to travel by car.

This decision will disproportionately affect people who are disabled, working class people, and people of color.

As a unit, we recognize our privilege living in NYC, and extend our unwavering support to folks all across the country whose lives depend on life-changing action from the Supreme Court.

The members of the Transportation Alternatives Union stand in solidarity with working people nationwide who have fought for and unquestionably deserve bodily autonomy and access to quality health care.

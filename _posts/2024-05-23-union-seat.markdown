Last week, we sent a letter to TA’s Board of Directors asking for a seat on the selection committee for our next executive director. Union members represent the vast majority of TA’s staff — we need a seat at the table.

Union members don’t only make up nearly 75% of TA’s staff, we represent the majority of staff members who have been with the organization for more than five years.

TA staff had a limited, if not solely cosmetic, role in the last executive director search, and our union formed, in part, in response to being left out of this process. Union involvement will ensure our new executive leadership fits with TA’s culture and gets off to a strong start.

We urge TA’s board to give TA’s union a voting seat in the executive director search process.

We look forward to hearing the Board’s decision.

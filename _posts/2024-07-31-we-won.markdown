NYC rents are skyrocketing at a rate 7x faster than wages — squeezing out low- and middle-income residents. This is exactly why we are demanding a living wage for our lowest-paid workers. That’s why we demanded TA leadership step up for their workers.

Here’s some of what we won:

- 12 weeks of fully-paid parental leave
- A salary floor of $60,000 for our lowest-paid colleagues
- Fair policies for our staff who dedicate nights and weekends to the work
